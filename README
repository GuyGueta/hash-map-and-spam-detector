Description:
in this ex i practice templates. I had to create an open hash map, dealing with collisions
and  all the other fuck off the hash map.i also practice inner calls , i created the iterator ass a inner
class of the hash map, and practice exceptions.

Implementation:
HashMap.hpp -
This file includes the class of the hashmap, supporting all features of hash map including insert,
erase, containing and at(key). It supports the operators '=' and move assignment, '==', '!=', '[]'
access read and write. Rule of five has been implemented as well. This class also implements
iterator class as a constant iterator to iterate over all pairs in the hash map.

SpamDetector.cpp -
This file is basically parsing a given database in the format of "phrase,number" and recognize if a message is a spam or
not.
